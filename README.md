# PopularityVisualization

This is a data visualization for Eventbrite built using Backbone.js and d3.js. The data visualization consists of keywords pulled from the names and descriptions of popular events on Eventbrite. The app uses tf-idf weighting to extract keywords from the set of event descriptions and names.
